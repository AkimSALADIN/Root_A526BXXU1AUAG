Root_A526BXXU1AUAG

# Android 11 Root patch with Magisk instruction for Samsung Galaxy A52 5G (SM-A526B/DS).

This root is only tested on firmware A526BXXU1AUAG.
Use at your own risk !

I made that root because I tried to use [EFTSU tools](https://eftsu.com/) to root my A52 5G but without success.
So I decide make this root and share it if you want to root your phone in simple way.

### What's you need ?

* Unlock your bootloader.
* Download and install Samsung Drivers.
* Download Odin.
* Download "[ROOT_R11_A526BXXU1AUAG.tar](https://mega.nz/file/wkBX3SYL#B3HwuyLDRjJwEAR9RXAgBd8GH_TEJkXsfllmP9zOZQk)"

### How to use ?

After unlocking your bootloader, boot your phone into "Download Mode".

Open `Odin` and add the `ROOT_R11_A526BXXU1AUAG.tar` in AP section.

Flash by clicking "Start" button.

Done !

(After your phone is restarted, open Playstore and update Magisk app.)
